# GitHub Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `ai-business-analytics-agent`
   - Description: `AI-powered business analytics and reporting agent with MCP servers`
   - Set to **Public** (recommended for open source) or **Private**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd AI-Business-Analytics-Agent

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-business-analytics-agent.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all the files uploaded:
   - README.md with project documentation
   - Complete project structure
   - Database MCP Server implementation
   - Setup scripts and configuration files

## Step 4: Repository Settings (Optional)

### Add Topics/Tags
In your GitHub repository:
1. Click the gear icon next to "About"
2. Add topics: `ai`, `analytics`, `mcp-server`, `business-intelligence`, `typescript`, `nodejs`, `aws-athena`, `postgresql`, `redis`

### Enable Issues and Discussions
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Scroll down to "Features"
3. Enable "Issues" for bug tracking
4. Enable "Discussions" for community questions

### Add Repository Description
In the "About" section, add:
```
AI-powered business analytics agent that understands business problems, conducts data analysis using AWS Athena, and generates comprehensive reports with insights. Built with MCP servers architecture.
```

## Step 5: Share Your Repository

Your repository will be available at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-business-analytics-agent
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

If you prefer SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/ai-business-analytics-agent.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you encounter authentication issues:
1. **Personal Access Token**: GitHub requires personal access tokens for HTTPS
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
   - Use this token as your password when prompted

2. **SSH Keys**: Set up SSH keys for easier authentication
   - Follow GitHub's SSH key setup guide

### Repository Already Exists
If you get an error that the repository already exists:
1. Make sure you're using the correct repository name
2. Check if you already have a repository with this name
3. Either use a different name or delete the existing repository

## Next Steps After Upload

1. **Star your repository** to bookmark it
2. **Create issues** for tracking remaining implementation tasks
3. **Set up GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (optional)
4. **Invite collaborators** if working in a team
5. **Create releases** as you complete major milestones
